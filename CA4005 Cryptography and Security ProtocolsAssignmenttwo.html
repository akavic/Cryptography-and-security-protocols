        <p align="center"><strong><font size="5"><u>Digital Signature Using RSA</u></font></strong></p>
        <p><br>
          The aim of this assignment is to implement a digital signature using RSA.
          Before the digital signature can be implemented, you will need to set up an
          appropriate public/private RSA key pair. This should be done as follows:
	</p><ol>
        <li> Generate two distinct 512-bit <i>probable primes</i> <i>p</i> and <i>q</i></li>
	<li> Calculate the product of these two primes <i>N = pq</i></li>
	<li> Calculate the Euler totient function phi(<i>N</i>)</li>
        <li> You will be using an encryption exponent <i>e</i> = 65537, so you will need to ensure that this is relatively prime to phi(<i>N</i>). If it is not, go back to step 1 and generate new values for <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>
	</li><li> Compute the value for the decryption exponent <i>d</i>, which is the multiplicative inverse of <i>e</i> (mod phi(<i>N</i>)).
 This should use your own implementation of the extended Euclidean GCD 
algorithm to calculate the inverse rather than using a library method 
for this purpose.</li>
 	</ol><p></p>

 	<p>You should then write code to implement a decryption method which calculates <i>c<sup>d</sup></i> (mod <i>N</i>).
 You should use your own implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem
 to calculate this more efficiently; this can also make use of your 
multiplicative inverse implementation.</p>

        <p>Once your implementation is complete, you should create a zip file containing all your code and digitally sign a digest of this file as follows:
        </p><ol>
          <li>Generate a 256-bit digest of the zip file using SHA-256.</li>
          <li>Apply your decryption method to this digest. Note that for
 the purpose of this assignment no padding should be added to the 
digest.</li>
        </ol><p></p>

        <p>You should send me the following by email:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Your 1024-bit modulus <i>N</i> in hexadecimal.</li>
          <li>Your zipped code file.</li>
          <li>The digitally signed code digest in hexadecimal.</li>
          <li>A declaration that this is solely your own work (except elements that are explicitly attributed to another source).</li>
        </ul>

	<p>The implementation language must be Java. You can make use of the 
    BigInteger class (java.math.BigInteger), the security
    libraries (java.security.*) and the crypto libraries
(javax.crypto.*). You must not make use of the multiplicative inverse or
 GCD methods provided by the BigInteger class; you will need to 
implement these yourself. You can however make use of the crypto 
libraries to perform the SHA-256 hashing.</p>

 	<p>When I receive your email I will generate a 256-bit digest of your 
zipped code file using SHA-256 and decrypt your digital signature using the exponent
 <i>e</i> = 65537 and modulus <i>N</i>; these two values should be the same for a correct submission.</p>

        <p> This assignment is due <b>10am on Monday 5<sup>th</sup> December.
        <strong><u>Submissions without the declaration will not be assessed.</u></strong> 
          This assignment carries 15 marks and late submissions will be penalised 
          1.5 marks for each 24 hours the assignment is overdue.</b></p><b>
